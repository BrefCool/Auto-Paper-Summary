## Review of the build instruction and README of their project
The project is lack of build instruction. So it's hard to install all the packages on my local environment.  
In fact, pip provide great features to generate all the packages of your current python environment. So it's high recommended that they use 'pip freeze>requirements.txt'to put all the required packages to a file and upload it to the github.  
Their README successfully describe their project and introduction the dataset they use. It's very great! However, more specific details should be put in the README too.  

## Review about their technology selection
The choose python Django to be the website's backend, and use sqlite3 as their database.  
Python Django is very powerful and actually I also used the Django framework to host the website of my project. Sqlite3 works great when the amount of data is small, but they may encounter some problems when data is huge.
